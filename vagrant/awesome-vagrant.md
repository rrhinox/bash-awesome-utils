# ðŸ“¦  Vagrant awesome command line for day by day!

## Intro & Documentation

Vagrant is a tool for building complete development environments. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases development/production parity, and makes the ***"it works on  machine"*** excuse a relic of the past.

***What is Vagrant?***
Vagrant is the command line utility for managing the lifecycle of virtual machines. Isolate dependencies and their configuration within a single disposable and consistent environment.

## Main command 
+ `vagrant up` - Start all VMs using Vagrantfile (please enter into vagrant-cluster/ folder before run this command)
+ `vagrant status` - Check the status of the VM's
+ `vagrant ssh vm` - Open ssh on target VM
+ `vagrant destroy - Destroy specific instance or destroy all instances, without VM name
+ `vagrant suspend` - A suspend effectively saves the exact point-in-time state of the machine, so that when you resume it later, it begins running immediately from that point, rather than doing a full boot.
